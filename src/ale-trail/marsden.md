about: 'The brew-pub was opened in 1995 and purchased by the Ossett Brewery in 2006. The bar is on the ground floor with the micro brewery in the basement.'
directions: 'Leave the station on the downhill side, crossing a canal. The Railway pub is directly opposite the station but we will be carrying on down the hill towards the town. Follow the road round to the left and look for Peel Street (first on the right once you are round the corner). The pub is on the right a short way along Peel Street.'
